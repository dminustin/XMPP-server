# AMF XMPP Server
This is an experimental XMPP server writen in GO lang.

I saw some other XMPP Go Servers but their code soooo big and not scalable, in my not so humble opinion. 

I have write it to the support of my side project, 
but you may use my code as you wish.

I want to implement a bit of Jabber functionality:
- authorization (complete)
- messaging
- address book and statuses
- file transfer (XEP-0363) (in progress)
- offline messaging
- carbon copies (XEP-0280)
- Message Archive Management (XEP-0313)
- vcards


Right now App is under construction.

Please check todo.txt if you would like to know about my plans.

## Right now complete:
- configuration file
- user authorization
- some interactions with App: get info, get discovery, authorization
